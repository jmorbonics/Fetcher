<p align="center">
  <strong>Build your own autonomous vehicle</strong>
</p>

<br>

For your HackIllinois 2024 John Deere prompt, <strong>you are tasked with building your own autonomous vehicle, a vehicle that solves any problem that you define.</strong>

It is up to each team to determine what _problem_ your vehicle solves. Does it drive down the road? Deliver food? Solve a maze? Plant a corn field? It could be something useful, something fun, or anything you can imagine. The only stipulation is that your vehicle:

- Solves the problem autonomously, that is, makes decisions on its own
- Uses data from sensor(s) in its decisions

Each team is supplied with a [hardware kit](#john-deere-kit). Teams are welcome to add to the vehicle and kit as needed. Teams are not required to use all items in the kit.

Like many problems at John Deere, this prompt requires more than just a software solution, it requires a solution at the intersection of mechanical systems, electrical systems, sensors, data, automation, programming, and of course, creativity.

Good luck!

## Setup Instructions

Follow along for the recommended setup instructions

- power on your raspberry pi
- connect raspberry pi to your computer via ethernet cable
- ssh into raspberry pi on your computer
- If you want graphical access (to see a screen) follow along below
  - get raspberry pi onto the same internet network as your computer
  - find IP address of raspberry pi
  - establish a VNC connection to raspberry pi

## Connecting to your Raspberry Pi

There are few ways to access your raspberry pi:

1. Keyboard, Mouse, Monitor
2. SSH (from another computer)
3. VNC (from another computer)

### Keyboard, Mouse, Monitor

You can use a raspberry pi like any other computer. Connect a keyboard and mouse via usb (or bluetooth) and connect a monitor to the Mini HDMI port.

### [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) (Command Line Access)

You can establish an ssh connection for access to the raspberry pi terminal.

**1a. With direct ethernet connection**

- `ssh <username>@<hostname>.local`
- `ssh pi@hackilpi1.local`

**1b. While on same network**

- `ssh <username>@<ip_address>`
- `ssh pi@10.0.0.35`

**2. Enter your password**

### VNC (Graphical Access)

You can establish a VNC connection for graphical access to the raspberry pi.

**1. Download a VNC Viewer**

Something like [RealVNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/combined/)

<p align="center">
  <img

    width="500"
  />
</p>

**4. Enter your password**

_note_: you may need to [enable VNC access](https://raspberrypi-guide.github.io/networking/connecting-via-VNC#enable-vnc-on-the-raspberry-pi) on your raspberry pi

**5. Control the Raspberry Pi**

Use the window on your computer to access your Raspberry Pi's OS.

## Secure Copy

Secure Copy, `scp`, allows you to transfer files between two locations, using the [SSH](#ssh-command-line-access) protocol. Check out [`copy_repo_to_pi.sh`](copy_repo_to_pi.sh) for an example.

## Find IP Address

To find the IP address of your raspberry pi, run

`ifconfig`

Look for `inet`.

## Other Tips

### Connecting to Wifi

You may wish to connect to your raspberry pi without a direct ethernet connection. Follow along for instructions on connecting to a network.

**1. Edit the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file**

`sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`

**2. Add your network**

Add the following lines to the file, substituing your network's SSID and password

```
network={
    ssid="your_SSID"
    psk="your_password"
}
```

**3. Restart the networking service**

`sudo systemctl restart networking`

## Raspberry Pi Pin Layout

To power on the Raspberry Pi, attach the USB-C cable.

<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html">
  <p align="center">
    <img
      src="./static/images/GPIO-Pinout-Diagram-2.png"
      alt="Ultrasonic Sensor"
      width="500"
    />
  </p>
</a>

## Raspberry Pi HAT

To simplify the wiring process, a Raspberry Pi HAT is provided for you. The HAT is placed directly on top of the Raspberry Pi. In the schematic, square pins designate `Pin 1`. To power on the circuit board, attach the micro USB cable.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="./static/images/Raspberry Pi HAT Schematic.png"
    alt="Raspberry Pi HAT Schematic"
    width="500"
  />
    <img
      src="./static/images/Raspberry Pi HAT.png"
      alt="Raspberry Pi HAT"
      width="500"
  />
</p>

### [H-Bridge][h_bridge]

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="./static/images/H-Bridge.jpg"
    alt="H-Bridge"
    width="500"
  />
</p>

**Ensure proper H-Bridge orientation by checking that the notch on the H-Bridge matches the notch on the board.**

Each side (motor) of the H-Bridge takes in three inputs sent by the raspberry pi:

- speed (pwm signal)
- control 1 (binary signal)
- control 2 (binary signal)

The **direction** of the motor is controlled by sending high (3.3V) or low (0V) voltage to controls 1 and 2.

| Control 1 | Control 2 | Motor Direction |
| --------- | --------- | --------------- |
| HIGH      | HIGH      | n/a             |
| HIGH      | LOW       | Forward         |
| LOW       | HIGH      | Backward        |
| LOW       | LOW       | n/a             |

The **speed** of the given motor is determined by the [duty cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_cycle) of the [PWM signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation). A duty cycle of 100% turns the motor at 100% speed, a duty cycle of 50% turns the motor at 50% speed. Read the source code for examples.

### Slide Switch - Motor Power Circuit

A slide switch is already assembled for you. Located next to the micro USB port, this switch controls the **motor power circuit**.

It has two states:

- **on**: slid _away_ from the micro USB port - current flows to motors
- **off**: slid _toward_ to the micro USB port - current does not flow to motors

### Button Switches

Labeled `Switch 1` and `Switch 2` on the board, these button switches signal to the Raspberry Pi whether they are currently being pressed. The `state` of the switch can be tracked with software.

### LEDs

Two LEDs are provided for you on the board. They are controlled by the Raspberry Pi.

## Other Components

You are required to wire the following components to your vehicle. To insert wires into the green terminal blocks, push down on the top, insert the wire, and release. Test your connecting by gently pulling on the connected wire.

### [Camera][camera]

Follow along with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GImeVqHQzsE) to install your camera.

Other helpful camera resources:

- https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/camera/picamera2-manual.pdf
- https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/camera_software.html#python-bindings-for-libcamera

### [Distance Sensor][distance_sensor]

Connect the pins of each ultrasonic distance sensor in their appropriate appropriate locations. You will need to remove the plastic caps from the jumper wires before inserting into the green terminal blocks.

### [Motor][motor]

Connect each motor's positive and negative terminals at the assigned pins. If your motor turns in the opposite direction you expect, swap the polarity by switching the wires.

**Motor not turning?**

Make sure your [motor power slide switch](#slide-switch-motor-power-circuit) is on.

**Still not turning?**

You may have blown a fuse in the motor circuit. Reach out for help.
