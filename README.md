# Inspiration
The idea to create Fetcher, our robot designed to assist in locating items at a grocery store stemmed from the lack of helpful technology in shopping. We were particularly inspired by international students, many of whom struggled to navigate our local Target aisles with a language barrier and struggling to find specific products. Additionally, the experiences of elderly individuals who struggle to read at a distance or locate goods based on signs deeply influenced our design process. Driven by a commitment to inclusivity and accessibility, we ensured that Fetcher would be a valuable companion for people of all ages and backgrounds.

# What it does
Fetcher uses computer vision, deep neural network image processing, natural language processing, and sensory input to intelligently navigate stores while providing the best possible customer experience. Fetcher initially starts in sentry mode, waiting at one of the QR Code homebases strategically placed at the end of each aisle. When a customer says, "Hey, Fetcher," Fetcher wakes up and begins listening to their speech. With support of almost any language, Fetcher intelligently parses their natural dialogue to determine the item they are looking for. Fetcher then leads the way, guiding the customer to their desired item in the store before returning to a QR Code homebase, ready to help the next user.

# How we built it
Our physical robot was built with a combination of 3d printing, the given hardware kit, and a microphone. For 3D printing, we mounted ultrasonic sensors to the front and back of the bot for object avoidance and user leading functionality, as well as securely attaching our Raspberry Pi, Blue Snowball microphone, and camera module. The interfacing was then done via SSH and a VNC Viewer virtual desktop, which allowed us to deploy and integrate our locally-written code on the Pi. Upon receiving a wake word from the customer, Fetcher will activate using Picovoice's Porcupine wake word NLP model, and listen to the user's request. The user will be able to speak to Fetcher in any language, and Fetcher will process the formatted .wav file through Google's speech-to-text and translation apis. Given the translated phrases, Fetcher makes a call to OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5 turbo model to simplify and parse the input phrase into a list of groceries the customer desires to purchase. The following list will then be processed through a python script that determines the navigation of Fetcher through the grocery store based on QR Codes. The QR codes are actually April Tags, which are scanned and recognized through Fetcher's right facing camera. Using the pupil-apriltags library and detector along with opencv, we were able to decode the unique ID of each april tag, using this to store information about what items are housed in each aisle, so that Fetcher can decide if he should turn or continue onwards. When Fetcher traverses the aisle, a deep neural network trained on object detection is constantly ran with the camera input, detecting if we have reached our destination. This YOLO (You Only Look Once) model accurately identifies a wide range of objects, greatly encompassing our scope of store items. Finally, our ultrasonic sensors ensure we don't run into anything in the front or back while walking down the aisles and returning to an april tag homebase.

# Challenges we ran into
Our biggest challenge was code integration. Since we decided to divide work evenly among team members, each person created an algorithm for a different step in the item finding process. Upon combination of code, we ran into a number of errors, from resolving module imports, to opencv not working on the pi, to our hat's microusb port falling off. In the end we were able to fix these problems, but in the future we may begin to integrate our code at more frequent intervals. We also had a fuse blow between our H bridge and motor ports which turned out to be an exciting (yet time consuming) multimeter filled learning experience.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
This was our group's first hardware hackathon, and we are very proud to have created a working proof of concept. Most of our group had never had any electrical experience, so coding in a Raspberry Pi terminal was new and exiting. None of us had prior computer vision experience or API plugin usage, so we are proud to have integrated all of these pieces into our final code!

# What we learned
We learned that consistent integration is critical to the final creation of a product.

# What's next for Fetcher
Fetcher was built with scaling in mind. Ideally, Fetcher will soon have multi-shelf compatibility, allowing the camera to scan entire rows at once, exponentially increasing the number of items able to be found. Later on, Fetcher could also include an arm mechanism, allowing for the picking of goods of a shelf removing the need to shop in person. In addition, Fetcher can be trained to recognize empty shelves, alerting store employees that certain items need to be restocked.

# Built With
apriltags, chatgpt, cmake, opencv, picovoice, python, and yolo ML models

  <strong>Build your own autonomous vehicle</strong>
</p>

<br>

For your HackIllinois 2024 John Deere prompt, <strong>you are tasked with building your own autonomous vehicle, a vehicle that solves any problem that you define.</strong>

It is up to each team to determine what _problem_ your vehicle solves. Does it drive down the road? Deliver food? Solve a maze? Plant a corn field? It could be something useful, something fun, or anything you can imagine. The only stipulation is that your vehicle:

- Solves the problem autonomously, that is, makes decisions on its own
- Uses data from sensor(s) in its decisions

Each team is supplied with a [hardware kit](#john-deere-kit). Teams are welcome to add to the vehicle and kit as needed. Teams are not required to use all items in the kit.

Like many problems at John Deere, this prompt requires more than just a software solution, it requires a solution at the intersection of mechanical systems, electrical systems, sensors, data, automation, programming, and of course, creativity.

Good luck!

    <em>A fully wired vehicle</em>
  </p>

## Raspberry Pi Pin Layout

To power on the Raspberry Pi, attach the USB-C cable.

<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html">
  <p align="center">
    <img
      src="./static/images/GPIO-Pinout-Diagram-2.png"
      alt="Ultrasonic Sensor"
      width="500"
    />
  </p>
</a>

## Raspberry Pi HAT

To simplify the wiring process, a Raspberry Pi HAT is provided for you. The HAT is placed directly on top of the Raspberry Pi. In the schematic, square pins designate `Pin 1`. To power on the circuit board, attach the micro USB cable.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="./static/images/Raspberry Pi HAT Schematic.png"
    alt="Raspberry Pi HAT Schematic"
    width="500"
  />
    <img
      src="./static/images/Raspberry Pi HAT.png"
      alt="Raspberry Pi HAT"
      width="500"
  />
</p>

### [H-Bridge][h_bridge]

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="./static/images/H-Bridge.jpg"
    alt="H-Bridge"
    width="500"
  />
</p>

**Ensure proper H-Bridge orientation by checking that the notch on the H-Bridge matches the notch on the board.**

Each side (motor) of the H-Bridge takes in three inputs sent by the raspberry pi:

- speed (pwm signal)
- control 1 (binary signal)
- control 2 (binary signal)

The **direction** of the motor is controlled by sending high (3.3V) or low (0V) voltage to controls 1 and 2.

| Control 1 | Control 2 | Motor Direction |
| --------- | --------- | --------------- |
| HIGH      | HIGH      | n/a             |
| HIGH      | LOW       | Forward         |
| LOW       | HIGH      | Backward        |
| LOW       | LOW       | n/a             |

The **speed** of the given motor is determined by the [duty cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_cycle) of the [PWM signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation). A duty cycle of 100% turns the motor at 100% speed, a duty cycle of 50% turns the motor at 50% speed. Read the source code for examples.

### Slide Switch - Motor Power Circuit

A slide switch is already assembled for you. Located next to the micro USB port, this switch controls the **motor power circuit**.

It has two states:

- **on**: slid _away_ from the micro USB port - current flows to motors
- **off**: slid _toward_ to the micro USB port - current does not flow to motors

### Button Switches

Labeled `Switch 1` and `Switch 2` on the board, these button switches signal to the Raspberry Pi whether they are currently being pressed. The `state` of the switch can be tracked with software.

### LEDs

Two LEDs are provided for you on the board. They are controlled by the Raspberry Pi.

## Other Components

You are required to wire the following components to your vehicle. To insert wires into the green terminal blocks, push down on the top, insert the wire, and release. Test your connecting by gently pulling on the connected wire.

### [Camera][camera]

Follow along with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GImeVqHQzsE) to install your camera.

Other helpful camera resources:

- https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/camera/picamera2-manual.pdf
- https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/camera_software.html#python-bindings-for-libcamera

### [Distance Sensor][distance_sensor]

Connect the pins of each ultrasonic distance sensor in their appropriate appropriate locations. You will need to remove the plastic caps from the jumper wires before inserting into the green terminal blocks.

### [Motor][motor]

Connect each motor's positive and negative terminals at the assigned pins. If your motor turns in the opposite direction you expect, swap the polarity by switching the wires.

**Motor not turning?**

Make sure your [motor power slide switch](#slide-switch-motor-power-circuit) is on.

**Still not turning?**

You may have blown a fuse in the motor circuit. Reach out for help.
